To allow individual users to curate their own map layers and enable other users to subscribe to and like those layers, we can structure the application as follows:
1. User Authentication:
Implement user registration and login functionality.
Store user information, including their unique identifier, in a database.
2. Map Layer Creation:
Allow authenticated users to create their own map layers.
Each map layer should have properties such as name, description, and associated data (e.g., markers, polygons, lines).
Store the map layer information in a database, associating it with the user who created it.
3. User-Layer Relationship:
Create a database table or collection to establish relationships between users and map layers.
This table should store information about which users have subscribed to or liked specific map layers.
4. Map Layer Retrieval:
When a user accesses the application, retrieve the map layers they have subscribed to based on the user-layer relationship data.
Fetch the associated data for each subscribed map layer from the database.
5. Map Layer Display:
Render the subscribed map layers on the user's map interface.
Allow users to toggle the visibility of individual map layers.
6. Layer Subscription and Liking:
Implement functionality for users to subscribe to or unsubscribe from map layers created by other users.
Add options for users to like or unlike map layers.
Update the user-layer relationship data in the database accordingly.
7. Layer Discovery:
Create a search or exploration feature where users can discover map layers created by other users.
Display information about each map layer, such as the creator, description, and the number of subscribers and likes.
8. Real-time Updates (optional):
If desired, implement real-time updates using technologies like WebSockets or server-sent events.
When a user makes changes to their map layer (e.g., adding or removing markers), propagate those updates to all subscribed users in real-time.
9. User Profile and Layer Management:
Create user profile pages where users can view and manage their created map layers.
Allow users to edit or delete their own map layers.
10. API Design:
Design a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for users, map layers, and user-layer relationships.
Implement appropriate endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.
