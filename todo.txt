UI for curating map layers: Consider use cases
 - User wants to curate a list of the best pizza restaurants
 - Band wants to list their upcoming show
 - RISCA wants to share points of interest for PVDFest

 - What's new in the neighborhood algorithm


 - drop marker -> fill in info
 - import from api

UI for businesses (speak on the map)
 - Anything a business posts will be visible on the map regardless of active layers - but the user can hide them. ("Only show my layers")
 - zillow-style location targeting of users (geofence) 

What is a "Hey Therr"?
 - a heytherr is a message from a business to the neighborhood/public
 - temporary heytherrs can be targeted to specific locations/days/times
 - businesses can create heytherrs
 - curators can create heytherrs for businesses
 - businesses can delete/disable curators heytherrs
